  "content": "Semantic search denotes search with meaning, as distinguished from lexical search where the search engine looks for literal matches of the query words or variants of them, without understanding the overall meaning of the query. Semantic search is an approach to information retrieval that seeks to improve search accuracy by understanding the searcher's intent and the contextual meaning of terms as they appear in the searchable dataspace, whether on the Web or within a closed system, to generate more relevant results. Modern semantic search systems often use vector embeddings to represent words, phrases, or documents as numerical vectors, allowing the retrieval engine to measure similarity based on meaning rather than exact keyword matches.\nSome authors regard semantic search as a set of techniques for retrieving knowledge from richly structured data sources like ontologies and XML as found on the Semantic Web. Such technologies enable the formal articulation of domain knowledge at a high level of expressiveness and could enable the user to specify their intent in more detail at query time. The articulation enhances content relevance and depth by including specific places, people, or concepts relevant to the query.\n\n\n== Models and tools ==\nTools like Google's Knowledge Graph provide structured relationships between entities to enrich query interpretation.\nModels like BERT and Sentence-BERT convert words or sentences into dense vectors for similarity comparison.\nSemantic ontologies like Web Ontology Language, Resource Description Framework, and Schema.org organize concepts and relationships, allowing systems to infer related terms and deeper meanings.\nHybrid search models combine lexical retrieval (e.g., BM25) with semantic ranking using pretrained transformer models for optimal performance.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of search engines\nSemantic web\nSemantic unification\nResource Description Framework\nNatural language search engine\nSemantic query\nVector database\nWord embeddings\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSemantic Search 2008 Workshop at ESWC'08\nSemantic Search 2010 Workshop at WWW2010\nWorkshop on Exploiting Semantic Annotations in Information Retrieval at ECIR'08."
