  "content": "In machine learning, support vector machines (SVMs, also support vector networks) are supervised max-margin models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data for classification and regression analysis. Developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories, SVMs are one of the most studied models, being based on statistical learning frameworks of VC theory proposed by Vapnik (1982, 1995) and Chervonenkis (1974).\nIn addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform non-linear classification using the kernel trick, representing the data only through a set of pairwise similarity comparisons between the original data points using a kernel function, which transforms them into coordinates in a higher-dimensional feature space. Thus, SVMs use the kernel trick to implicitly map their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces, where linear classification can be performed.  Being max-margin models, SVMs are resilient to noisy data (e.g., misclassified examples). SVMs can also be used for regression tasks, where the objective becomes \n  \n    \n      \n        ϵ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\epsilon }\n  \n-sensitive.\nThe support vector clustering algorithm, created by Hava Siegelmann and Vladimir Vapnik, applies the statistics of support vectors, developed in the support vector machines algorithm, to categorize unlabeled data. These data sets require unsupervised learning approaches, which attempt to find natural clustering of the data into groups, and then to map new data according to these clusters.\nThe popularity of SVMs is likely due to their amenability to theoretical analysis, and their flexibility in being applied to a wide variety of tasks, including structured prediction problems. It is not clear that SVMs have better predictive performance than other linear models, such as logistic regression and linear regression.\n\n\n== Motivation ==\n\nClassifying data is a common task in machine learning.\nSuppose some given data points each belong to one of two classes, and the goal is to decide which class a new data point will be in. In the case of support vector machines, a data point is viewed as a \n  \n    \n      \n        p\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p}\n  \n-dimensional vector (a list of \n  \n    \n      \n        p\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p}\n  \n numbers), and we want to know whether we can separate such points with a \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        p\n        −\n        1\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (p-1)}\n  \n-dimensional hyperplane. This is called a linear classifier. There are many hyperplanes that might classify the data. One reasonable choice as the best hyperplane is the one that represents the largest separation, or margin, between the two classes. So we choose the hyperplane so that the distance from it to the nearest data point on each side is maximized. If such a hyperplane exists, it is known as the maximum-margin hyperplane and the linear classifier it defines is known as a maximum-margin classifier; or equivalently, the perceptron of optimal stability.\nMore formally, a support vector machine constructs a hyperplane or set of hyperplanes in a high or infinite-dimensional space, which can be used for classification, regression, or other tasks like outlier detection. Intuitively, a good separation is achieved by the hyperplane that has the largest distance to the nearest training-data point of any class (so-called functional margin), since in general the larger the margin, the lower the generalization error of the classifier. A lower generalization error means that the implementer is less likely to experience overfitting.\nWhereas the original problem may be stated in a finite-dimensional space, it often happens that the sets to discriminate are not linearly separable in that space. For this reason, it was proposed that the original finite-dimensional space be mapped into a much higher-dimensional space, presumably making the separation easier in that space. To keep the computational load reasonable, the mappings used by SVM schemes are designed to ensure that dot products of pairs of input data vectors may be computed easily in terms of the variables in the original space, by defining them in terms of a kernel function \n  \n    \n      \n        k\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k(x,y)}\n  \n selected to suit the problem. The hyperplanes in the higher-dimensional space are defined as the set of points whose dot product with a vector in that space is constant, where such a set of vectors is an orthogonal (and thus minimal) set of vectors that defines a hyperplane. The vectors defining the hyperplanes can be chosen to be linear combinations with parameters \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          α\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\alpha _{i}}\n  \n of images of feature vectors \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{i}}\n  \n that occur in the data base. With this choice of a hyperplane, the points \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n in the feature space that are mapped into the hyperplane are defined by the relation \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            ∑\n            \n              i\n            \n          \n          \n            α\n            \n              i\n            \n          \n          k\n          (\n          \n            x\n            \n              i\n            \n          \n          ,\n          x\n          )\n          =\n          \n            constant\n          \n          .\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\textstyle \\sum _{i}\\alpha _{i}k(x_{i},x)={\\text{constant}}.}\n  \n  Note that if \n  \n    \n      \n        k\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k(x,y)}\n  \n becomes small as \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y}\n  \n grows further away from \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n, each term in the sum measures the degree of closeness of the test point \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n to the corresponding data base point \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{i}}\n  \n. In this way, the sum of kernels above can be used to measure the relative nearness of each test point to the data points originating in one or the other of the sets to be discriminated. Note the fact that the set of points \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n mapped into any hyperplane can be quite convoluted as a result, allowing much more complex discrimination between sets that are not convex at all in the original space.\n\n\n== Applications ==\nSVMs can be used to solve various real-world problems:\n\nSVMs are helpful in text and hypertext categorization, as their application can significantly reduce the need for labeled training instances in both the standard inductive and transductive settings. Some methods for shallow semantic parsing are based on support vector machines.\nClassification of images can also be performed using SVMs. Experimental results show that SVMs achieve significantly higher search accuracy than traditional query refinement schemes after just three to four rounds of relevance feedback. This is also true for image segmentation systems, including those using a modified version SVM that uses the privileged approach as suggested by Vapnik.\nClassification of satellite data like SAR data using supervised SVM.\nHand-written characters can be recognized using SVM.\nThe SVM algorithm has been widely applied in the biological and other sciences.  They have been used to classify proteins with up to 90% of the compounds classified correctly. Permutation tests based on SVM weights have been suggested as a mechanism for interpretation of SVM models. Support vector machine weights have also been used to interpret SVM models in the past. Posthoc interpretation of support vector machine models in order to identify features used by the model to make predictions is a relatively new area of research with special significance in the biological sciences.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe original SVM algorithm was invented by Vladimir N. Vapnik and Alexey Ya. Chervonenkis in 1964. In 1992, Bernhard Boser, Isabelle Guyon and Vladimir Vapnik suggested a way to create nonlinear classifiers by applying the kernel trick to maximum-margin hyperplanes. The \"soft margin\" incarnation, as is commonly used in software packages, was proposed by Corinna Cortes and Vapnik in 1993 and published in 1995.\n\n\n== Linear SVM ==\n\nWe are given a training dataset of \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n points of the form\n\n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          \n            x\n          \n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          y\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n        …\n        ,\n        (\n        \n          \n            x\n          \n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          y\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (\\mathbf {x} _{1},y_{1}),\\ldots ,(\\mathbf {x} _{n},y_{n}),}\n  \n\nwhere the \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          y\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y_{i}}\n  \n are either 1 or −1, each indicating the class to which the point \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            x\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {x} _{i}}\n  \n belongs.

However, in 1992, Bernhard Boser, Isabelle Guyon and Vladimir Vapnik suggested a way to create nonlinear classifiers by applying the kernel trick (originally proposed by Aizerman et al.) to maximum-margin hyperplanes. The kernel trick, where dot products are replaced by kernels, is easily derived in the dual representation of the SVM problem. This allows the algorithm to fit the maximum-margin hyperplane in a transformed feature space. The transformation may be nonlinear and the transformed space high-dimensional; although the classifier is a hyperplane in the transformed feature space, it may be nonlinear in the original input space.\nIt is noteworthy that working in a higher-dimensional feature space increases the generalization error of support vector machines, although given enough samples the algorithm still performs well.\nSome common kernels include:\n\nPolynomial (homogeneous): \n  \n    \n      \n        k\n        (\n        \n          \n            x\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          \n            x\n          \n          \n            j\n          \n        \n        )\n        =\n        (\n        \n          \n            x\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        ⋅\n        \n          \n            x\n          \n          \n            j\n          \n        \n        \n          )\n          \n            d\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k(\\mathbf {x} _{i},\\mathbf {x} _{j})=(\\mathbf {x} _{i}\\cdot \\mathbf {x} _{j})^{d}}\n  \n.

A special property is that they simultaneously minimize the empirical classification error and maximize the geometric margin; hence they are also known as maximum margin classifiers.\nA comparison of the SVM to other classifiers has been made by Meyer, Leisch and Hornik.\n\n\n=== Parameter selection ===\nThe effectiveness of SVM depends on the selection of kernel, the kernel's parameters, and soft margin parameter \n  \n    \n      \n        λ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lambda }\n  \n.\nA common choice is a Gaussian kernel, which has a single parameter \n  \n    \n      \n        γ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\gamma }\n  \n.

The final model, which is used for testing and for classifying new data, is then trained on the whole training set using the selected parameters.\n\n\n=== Issues ===\nPotential drawbacks of the SVM include the following aspects:\n\nRequires full labeling of input data\nUncalibrated class membership probabilities—SVM stems from Vapnik's theory which avoids estimating probabilities on finite data\nThe SVM is only directly applicable for two-class tasks. Therefore, algorithms that reduce the multi-class task to several binary problems have to be applied; see the multi-class SVM section.\nParameters of a solved model are difficult to interpret.\n\n\n== Extensions ==\n\n\n=== Multiclass SVM ===\nMulticlass SVM aims to assign labels to instances by using support vector machines, where the labels are drawn from a finite set of several elements.\nThe dominant approach for doing so is to reduce the single multiclass problem into multiple binary classification problems. Common methods for such reduction include:\n\nBuilding binary classifiers that distinguish between one of the labels and the rest (one-versus-all) or between every pair of classes (one-versus-one). Classification of new instances for the one-versus-all case is done by a winner-takes-all strategy, in which the classifier with the highest-output function assigns the class (it is important that the output functions be calibrated to produce comparable scores). For the one-versus-one approach, classification is done by a max-wins voting strategy, in which every classifier assigns the instance to one of the two classes, then the vote for the assigned class is increased by one vote, and finally the class with the most votes determines the instance classification.\nDirected acyclic graph SVM (DAGSVM)\nError-correcting output codes\nCrammer and Singer proposed a multiclass SVM method which casts the multiclass classification problem into a single optimization problem, rather than decomposing it into multiple binary classification problems.

Vapnik in 1998.\n\n\n=== Structured SVM ===\n\nStructured support-vector machine is an extension of the traditional SVM model. While the SVM model is primarily designed for binary classification, multiclass classification, and regression tasks, structured SVM broadens its application to handle general structured output labels, for example parse trees, classification with taxonomies, sequence alignment and many more.\n\n\n=== Regression ===\n\nA version of SVM for regression was proposed in 1996 by Vladimir N. Vapnik, Harris Drucker, Christopher J. C. Burges, Linda Kaufman and Alexander J. Smola. This method is called support vector regression (SVR). The model produced by support vector classification (as described above) depends only on a subset of the training data, because the cost function for building the model does not care about training points that lie beyond the margin. Analogously, the model produced by SVR depends only on a subset of the training data, because the cost function for building the model ignores any training data close to the model prediction. Another SVM version known as least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) has been proposed by Suykens and Vandewalle.\nTraining the original SVR means solving\n\nminimize \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              1\n              2\n            \n          \n        \n        ‖\n        w\n        \n          ‖\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {1}{2}}\\|w\\|^{2}}\n  \n\nsubject to \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          |\n        \n        \n          y\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        −\n        ⟨\n        w\n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        ⟩\n        −\n        b\n        \n          |\n        \n        ≤\n        ε\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle |y_{i}-\\langle w,x_{i}\\rangle -b|\\leq \\varepsilon }\n  \n\nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{i}}\n  \n is a training sample with target value \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          y\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y_{i}}\n  \n.

Slack variables are usually added into the above to allow for errors and to allow approximation in the case the above problem is infeasible.\n\n\n=== Bayesian SVM ===\nIn 2011 it was shown by Polson and Scott that the SVM admits a Bayesian interpretation through the technique of data augmentation. In this approach the SVM is viewed as a graphical model (where the parameters are connected via probability distributions). This extended view allows the application of Bayesian techniques to SVMs, such as flexible feature modeling, automatic hyperparameter tuning, and predictive uncertainty quantification. In 2017, a scalable version of the Bayesian SVM was developed by Florian Wenzel, enabling the application of Bayesian SVMs to big data. Florian Wenzel developed two different versions, a variational inference (VI) scheme for the Bayesian kernel support vector machine (SVM) and a stochastic version (SVI) for the linear Bayesian SVM.\n\n\n== Implementation ==\nThe parameters of the maximum-margin hyperplane are derived by solving the optimization. There exist several specialized algorithms for quickly solving the quadratic programming (QP) problem that arises from SVMs, mostly relying on heuristics for breaking the problem down into smaller, more manageable chunks.\nAnother approach is to use an interior-point method that uses Newton-like iterations to find a solution of the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions of the primal and dual problems.\nInstead of solving a sequence of broken-down problems, this approach directly solves the problem altogether. To avoid solving a linear system involving the large kernel matrix, a low-rank approximation to the matrix is often used in the kernel trick.\nAnother common method is Platt's sequential minimal optimization (SMO) algorithm, which breaks the problem down into 2-dimensional sub-problems that are solved analytically, eliminating the need for a numerical optimization algorithm and matrix storage. This algorithm is conceptually simple, easy to implement, generally faster, and has better scaling properties for difficult SVM problems.\nThe special case of linear support vector machines can be solved more efficiently by the same kind of algorithms used to optimize its close cousin, logistic regression; this class of algorithms includes sub-gradient descent (e.g., PEGASOS) and coordinate descent (e.g., LIBLINEAR). LIBLINEAR has some attractive training-time properties. Each convergence iteration takes time linear in the time taken to read the train data, and the iterations also have a Q-linear convergence property, making the algorithm extremely fast.\nThe general kernel SVMs can also be solved more efficiently using sub-gradient descent (e.g. P-packSVM), especially when parallelization is allowed.\nKernel SVMs are available in many machine-learning toolkits, including LIBSVM, MATLAB, SAS, SVMlight, kernlab, scikit-learn, Shogun, Weka, Shark, JKernelMachines, OpenCV and others.\nPreprocessing of data (standardization) is highly recommended to enhance accuracy of classification. There are a few methods of standardization, such as min-max, normalization by decimal scaling, Z-score. Subtraction of mean and division by variance of each feature is usually used for SVM.\n\n\n== See also ==\nIn situ adaptive tabulation\nKernel machines\nFisher kernel\nPlatt scaling\nPolynomial kernel\nPredictive analytics\nRegularization perspectives on support vector machines\nRelevance vector machine, a probabilistic sparse-kernel model identical in functional form to SVM\nSequential minimal optimization\nSpace mapping\nWinnow (algorithm)\nRadial basis function network\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBennett, Kristin P.; Campbell, Colin (2000). \"Support Vector Machines: Hype or Hallelujah?\" (PDF).
