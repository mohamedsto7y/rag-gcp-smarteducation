It was introduced by Sergey Ioffe and Christian Szegedy in 2015.\nExperts still debate why batch normalization works so well. It was initially thought to tackle internal covariate shift, a problem where parameter initialization and changes in the distribution of the inputs of each layer affect the learning rate of the network. However, newer research suggests it doesn’t fix this shift but instead smooths the objective function—a mathematical guide the network follows to improve—enhancing performance. In very deep networks, batch normalization can initially cause a severe gradient explosion—where updates to the network grow uncontrollably large—but this is managed with shortcuts called skip connections in residual networks. Another theory is that batch normalization adjusts data by handling its size and path separately, speeding up training.\n\n\n== Internal covariate shift ==\nEach layer in a neural network has inputs that follow a specific distribution, which shifts during training due to two main factors: the random starting values of the network’s settings (parameter initialization) and the natural variation in the input data. This shifting pattern affecting the inputs to the network’s inner layers is called internal covariate shift. While a strict definition isn’t fully agreed upon, experiments show that it involves changes in the means and variances of these inputs during training.\nBatch normalization was first developed to address internal covariate shift. During training, as the parameters of preceding layers adjust, the distribution of inputs to the current layer changes accordingly, such that the current layer needs to constantly readjust to new distributions. This issue is particularly severe in deep networks, because small changes in shallower hidden layers will be amplified as they propagate within the network, resulting in significant shift in deeper hidden layers. Batch normalization was proposed to reduced these unwanted shifts to speed up training and produce more reliable models.\nBeyond possibly tackling internal covariate shift, batch normalization offers several additional advantages. It allows the network to use a higher learning rate—a setting that controls how quickly the network learns—without causing problems like vanishing or exploding gradients, where updates become too small or too large. It also appears to have a regularizing effect, improving the network’s ability to generalize to new data, reducing the need for dropout, a technique used to prevent overfitting (when a model learns the training data too well and fails on new data). Additionally, networks using batch normalization are less sensitive to the choice of starting settings or learning rates, making them more robust and adaptable.\n\n\n== Procedures ==\n\n\n=== Transformation ===\nIn a neural network, batch normalization is achieved through a normalization step that fixes the means and variances of each layer's inputs. Ideally, the normalization would be conducted over the entire training set, but to use this step jointly with stochastic optimization methods, it is impractical to use the global information. Thus, normalization is restrained to each mini-batch in the training process.\nLet us use B to denote a mini-batch of size m of the entire training set. The empirical mean and variance of B could thus be denoted as\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          μ\n          \n            B\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            m\n          \n        \n        \n          ∑\n          \n            i\n            =\n            1\n          \n          \n            m\n          \n        \n        \n          x\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu _{B}={\\frac {1}{m}}\\sum _{i=1}^{m}x_{i}}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          σ\n          \n            B\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            m\n          \n        \n        \n          ∑\n          \n            i\n            =\n            1\n          \n          \n            m\n          \n        \n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        −\n        \n          μ\n          \n            B\n          \n        \n        \n          )\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sigma _{B}^{2}={\\frac {1}{m}}\\sum _{i=1}^{m}(x_{i}-\\mu _{B})^{2}}\n  \n.\nFor a layer of the network with d-dimensional input, \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        =\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n        ,\n        .\n        .\n        .\n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            (\n            d\n            )\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x=(x^{(1)},...,x^{(d)})}\n  \n, each dimension of its input is then normalized (i.e. re-centered and re-scaled) separately,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                x\n                ^\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            (\n            k\n            )\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                x\n                \n                  i\n                \n                \n                  (\n                  k\n                  )\n                \n              \n              −\n              \n                μ\n                \n                  B\n                \n                \n                  (\n                  k\n                  )\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  (\n                  \n                    σ\n                    \n                      B\n                    \n                    \n                      (\n                      k\n                      )\n                    \n                  \n                  )\n                \n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n              +\n              ϵ\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\hat {x}}_{i}^{(k)}={\\frac {x_{i}^{(k)}-\\mu _{B}^{(k)}}{\\sqrt {\\left(\\sigma _{B}^{(k)}\\right)^{2}+\\epsilon }}}}\n  \n, where \n  \n    \n      \n        k\n        ∈\n        [\n        1\n        ,\n        d\n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k\\in [1,d]}\n  \n and  \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n        ∈\n        [\n        1\n        ,\n        m\n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i\\in [1,m]}\n  \n; \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          μ\n          \n            B\n          \n          \n            (\n            k\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu _{B}^{(k)}}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          σ\n          \n            B\n          \n          \n            (\n            k\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sigma _{B}^{(k)}}\n  \n are the per-dimension mean and standard deviation, respectively.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        ϵ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\epsilon }\n  \n is added in the denominator for numerical stability and is an arbitrarily small positive constant.

Since the parameters are fixed in this transformation, the batch normalization procedure is essentially applying a linear transform to the activation function.\n\n\n== Theory ==\nAlthough batch normalization has become popular due to its strong empirical performance, the working mechanism of the method is not yet well-understood. The explanation made in the original paper was that batch norm works by reducing internal covariate shift, but this has been challenged by more recent work. One experiment trained a VGG-16 network under 3 different training regimes: standard (no batch norm), batch norm, and batch norm with noise added to each layer during training. In the third model, the noise has non-zero mean and non-unit variance, i.e. it explicitly introduces covariate shift. Despite this, it showed similar accuracy to the second model, and both performed better than the first, suggesting that covariate shift is not the reason that batch norm improves performance.\nUsing batch normalization causes the items in a batch to no longer be iid, which can lead to difficulties in training due to lower quality gradient estimation.\n\n\n=== Smoothness ===\nOne alternative explanation is that the improvement with batch normalization is instead due to producing a smoother parameter space and smoother gradients, as formalized by a smaller Lipschitz constant. \nConsider two identical networks, one contains batch normalization layers and the other does not, the behaviors of these two networks are then compared. Denote the loss functions as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              L\n              ^\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\hat {L}}}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        L\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L}\n  \n, respectively. Let the input to both networks be \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n, and the output be \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y}\n  \n, for which \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n        =\n        W\n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y=Wx}\n  \n, where \n  \n    \n      \n        W\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W}\n  \n is the layer weights. For the second network, \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y}\n  \n additionally goes through a batch normalization layer.

respectively.\nSome scholars argue that the above analysis cannot fully capture the performance of batch normalization, because the proof only concerns the largest eigenvalue, or equivalently, one direction in the landscape at all points. It is suggested that the complete eigenspectrum needs to be taken into account to make a conclusive analysis.\n\n\n=== Measure ===\nSince it is hypothesized that batch normalization layers could reduce internal covariate shift, an experiment is set up to measure quantitatively how much covariate shift is reduced. First, the notion of internal covariate shift needs to be defined mathematically. Specifically, to quantify the adjustment that a layer's parameters make in response to updates in previous layers, the correlation between the gradients of the loss before and after all previous layers are updated is measured, since gradients could capture the shifts from the first-order training method. If the shift introduced by the changes in previous layers is small, then the correlation between the gradients would be close to 1.\nThe correlation between the gradients are computed for four models: a standard VGG network, a VGG network with batch normalization layers, a 25-layer deep linear network (DLN) trained with full-batch gradient descent, and a DLN network with batch normalization layers. Interestingly, it is shown that the standard VGG and DLN models both have higher correlations of gradients compared with their counterparts, indicating that the additional batch normalization layers are not reducing internal covariate shift.\n\n\n=== Vanishing/exploding gradients ===\nEven though batch norm was originally introduced to alleviate gradient vanishing or explosion problems, a deep batch norm network in fact suffers from gradient explosion at initialization time, no matter what it uses for nonlinearity. Thus, the optimization landscape is very far from smooth for a randomly initialized, deep batch norm network.\nMore precisely, if the network has \n  \n    \n      \n        L\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L}\n  \n layers, then the gradient of the first layer weights has norm \n  \n    \n      \n        >\n        c\n        \n          λ\n          \n            L\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle >c\\lambda ^{L}}\n  \n for some \n  \n    \n      \n        λ\n        >\n        1\n        ,\n        c\n        >\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lambda >1,c>0}\n  \n depending only on the nonlinearity.\nFor any fixed nonlinearity, \n  \n    \n      \n        λ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lambda }\n  \n decreases as the batch size increases.

The previous section studies the effect of inserting a single batch norm in a network, while the gradient explosion depends on stacking batch norms typical of modern deep neural networks.\n\n\n=== Decoupling ===\nAnother possible reason for the success of batch normalization is that it decouples the length and direction of the weight vectors and thus facilitates better training.\nBy interpreting batch norm as a reparametrization of weight space, it can be shown that the length and the direction of the weights are separated and can thus be trained separately.
