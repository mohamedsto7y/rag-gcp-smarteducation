  "content": "Information retrieval (IR) in computing and information science is the task of identifying and retrieving information system resources that are relevant to an information need. The information need can be specified in the form of a search query. In the case of document retrieval, queries can be based on full-text or other content-based indexing. Information retrieval is the science of searching for information in a document, searching for documents themselves, and also searching for the metadata that describes data, and for databases of texts, images, or sounds. Cross-modal retrieval implies retrieval across modalities.\nAutomated information retrieval systems are used to reduce what has been called information overload. An IR system is a software system that provides access to books, journals, and other documents, as well as storing and managing those documents. Web search engines are the most visible IR applications.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nAn information retrieval process begins when a user enters a query into the system. Queries are formal statements of information needs, for example search strings in web search engines. In information retrieval, a query does not uniquely identify a single object in the collection. Instead, several objects may match the query, perhaps with different degrees of relevance.\nAn object is an entity that is represented by information in a content collection or database. User queries are matched against the database information. However, as opposed to classical SQL queries of a database, in information retrieval the results returned may or may not match the query, so results are typically ranked. This ranking of results is a key difference of information retrieval searching compared to database searching.\nDepending on the application the data objects may be, for example, text documents, images, audio, mind maps or videos. Often the documents themselves are not kept or stored directly in the IR system, but are instead represented in the system by document surrogates or metadata.\nMost IR systems compute a numeric score on how well each object in the database matches the query, and rank the objects according to this value. The top ranking objects are then shown to the user. The process may then be iterated if the user wishes to refine the query.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe idea of using computers to search for relevant pieces of information was popularized in the article As We May Think by Vannevar Bush in 1945. It would appear that Bush was inspired by patents for a 'statistical machine' – filed by Emanuel Goldberg in the 1920s and 1930s – that searched for documents stored on film. The first description of a computer searching for information was described by Holmstrom in 1948, detailing an early mention of the Univac computer. Automated information retrieval systems were introduced in the 1950s: one even featured in the 1957 romantic comedy Desk Set. In the 1960s, the first large information retrieval research group was formed by Gerard Salton at Cornell. By the 1970s several different retrieval techniques had been shown to perform well on small text corpora such as the Cranfield collection (several thousand documents). Large-scale retrieval systems, such as the Lockheed Dialog system, came into use early in the 1970s.\nIn 1992, the US Department of Defense along with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), cosponsored the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) as part of the TIPSTER text program. The aim of this was to look into the information retrieval community by supplying the infrastructure that was needed for evaluation of text retrieval methodologies on a very large text collection. This catalyzed research on methods that scale to huge corpora. The introduction of web search engines has boosted the need for very large scale retrieval systems even further.\nBy the late 1990s, the rise of the World Wide Web fundamentally transformed information retrieval. While early search engines such as AltaVista (1995) and Yahoo! (1994) offered keyword-based retrieval, they were limited in scale and ranking refinement. The breakthrough came in 1998 with the founding of Google, which introduced the PageRank algorithm, using the web's hyperlink structure to assess page importance and improve relevance ranking.\nDuring the 2000s, web search systems evolved rapidly with the integration of machine learning techniques. These systems began to incorporate user behavior data (e.g., click-through logs), query reformulation, and content-based signals to improve search accuracy and personalization. In 2009, Microsoft launched Bing, introducing features that would later incorporate semantic web technologies through the development of its Satori knowledge base. Academic analysis have highlighted Bing's semantic capabilities, including structured data use and entity recognition, as part of a broader industry shift toward improving search relevance and understanding user intent through natural language processing.\nA major leap occurred in 2018, when Google deployed BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to better understand the contextual meaning of queries and documents. This marked one of the first times deep neural language models were used at scale in real-world retrieval systems. BERT's bidirectional training enabled a more refined comprehension of word relationships in context, improving the handling of natural language queries. Because of its success, transformer-based models gained traction in academic research and commercial search applications.\nSimultaneously, the research community began exploring neural ranking models that outperformed traditional lexical-based methods. Long-standing benchmarks such as the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC), initiated in 1992, and more recent evaluation frameworks Microsoft MARCO(MAchine Reading COmprehension) (2019) became central to training and evaluating retrieval systems across multiple tasks and domains. MS MARCO has also been adopted in the TREC Deep Learning Tracks, where it serves as a core dataset for evaluating advances in neural ranking models within a standardized benchmarking environment.\nAs deep learning became integral to information retrieval systems, researchers began to categorize neural approaches into three broad classes: sparse, dense, and hybrid models. Sparse models, including traditional term-based methods and learned variants like SPLADE, rely on interpretable representations and inverted indexes to enable efficient exact term matching with added semantic signals. Dense models, such as dual-encoder architectures like ColBERT, use continuous vector embeddings to support semantic similarity beyond keyword overlap. Hybrid models aim to combine the advantages of both, balancing the lexical (token) precision of sparse methods with the semantic depth of dense models. This way of categorizing models balances scalability, relevance, and efficiency in retrieval systems.\nAs IR systems increasingly rely on deep learning, concerns around bias, fairness, and explainability have also come to the picture. Research is now focused not just on relevance and efficiency, but on transparency, accountability, and user trust in retrieval algorithms.\n\n\n== Applications ==\nAreas where information retrieval techniques are employed include (the entries are in alphabetical order within each category):\n\n\n=== General applications ===\nDigital libraries\nInformation filtering\nRecommender systems\nMedia search\nBlog search\nImage retrieval\n3D retrieval\nMusic retrieval\nNews search\nSpeech retrieval\nVideo retrieval\nSearch engines\nSite search\nDesktop search\nEnterprise search\nFederated search\nMobile search\nSocial search\nWeb search\n\n\n=== Domain-specific applications ===\nExpert search finding\nGenomic information retrieval\nGeographic information retrieval\nInformation retrieval for chemical structures\nInformation retrieval in software engineering\nLegal information retrieval\nVertical search\n\n\n=== Other retrieval methods ===\nMethods/Techniques in which information retrieval techniques are employed include:\n\nCross-modal retrieval\nAdversarial information retrieval\nAutomatic summarization\nMulti-document summarization\nCompound term processing\nCross-lingual retrieval\nDocument classification\nSpam filtering\nQuestion answering\n\n\n== Model types ==\n\nIn order to effectively retrieve relevant documents by IR strategies, the documents are typically transformed into a suitable representation. Each retrieval strategy incorporates a specific model for its document representation purposes. The picture on the right illustrates the relationship of some common models. In the picture, the models are categorized according to two dimensions: the mathematical basis and the properties of the model.\n\n\n=== First dimension: mathematical basis ===\nSet-theoretic models represent documents as sets of words or phrases. Similarities are usually derived from set-theoretic operations on those sets. Common models are:\nStandard Boolean model\nExtended Boolean model\nFuzzy retrieval\nAlgebraic models represent documents and queries usually as vectors, matrices, or tuples. The similarity of the query vector and document vector is represented as a scalar value.\nVector space model\nGeneralized vector space model\n(Enhanced) Topic-based Vector Space Model\nExtended Boolean model\nLatent semantic indexing a.k.a. latent semantic analysis\nProbabilistic models treat the process of document retrieval as a probabilistic inference. Similarities are computed as probabilities that a document is relevant for a given query. Probabilistic theorems like Bayes' theorem are often used in these models.\nBinary Independence Model\nProbabilistic relevance model on which is based the okapi (BM25) relevance function\nUncertain inference\nLanguage models\nDivergence-from-randomness model\nLatent Dirichlet allocation\nFeature-based retrieval models view documents as vectors of values of feature functions (or just features) and seek the best way to combine these features into a single relevance score, typically by learning to rank methods. Feature functions are arbitrary functions of document and query, and as such can easily incorporate almost any other retrieval model as just another feature.\nData fusion models: Data fusion in information retrieval combines results from multiple search systems or retrieval models to improve performance. By merging ranked lists, it leverages the strengths of diverse approaches, often enhancing recall and precision. Common methods include score normalization and voting techniques like CombSUM or Borda count. This meta-search strategy is particularly effective when individual systems have complementary coverage or when query difficulty varies, producing a more robust and reliable final ranking sparsity.\n\n\n=== Second dimension: properties of the model ===\nModels without term-interdependencies treat different terms/words as independent. This fact is usually represented in vector space models by the orthogonality assumption of term vectors or in probabilistic models by an independency assumption for term variables.\nModels with immanent term interdependencies allow a representation of interdependencies between terms. However the degree of the interdependency between two terms is defined by the model itself. It is usually directly or indirectly derived (e.g. by dimensional reduction) from the co-occurrence of those terms in the whole set of documents.\nModels with transcendent term interdependencies allow a representation of interdependencies between terms, but they do not allege how the interdependency between two terms is defined. They rely on an external source for the degree of interdependency between two terms. (For example, a human or sophisticated algorithms.)\n\n\n=== Third Dimension: representational approach-based classification ===\nIn addition to the theoretical distinctions, modern information retrieval models are also categorized on how queries and documents are represented and compared, using a practical classification distinguishing between sparse, dense and hybrid models.\n\nSparse models utilize interpretable, term-based representations and typically rely on inverted index structures. Classical methods such as TF-IDF and BM25 fall under this category, along with more recent learned sparse models that integrate neural architectures while retaining sparsity.\nDense models represent queries and documents as continuous vectors using deep learning models, typically transformer-based encoders. These models enable semantic similarity matching beyond exact term overlap and are used in tasks involving semantic search and question answering.\nHybrid models aim to combine the strengths of both approaches, integrating lexical (tokens) and semantic signals through score fusion, late interaction, or multi-stage ranking pipelines.\nThis classification has become increasingly common in both academic and the real world applications and is getting widely adopted and used in evaluation benchmarks for Information Retrieval models.\n\n\n== Performance and correctness measures ==\n\nThe evaluation of an information retrieval system' is the process of assessing how well a system meets the information needs of its users. In general, measurement considers a collection of documents to be searched and a search query. Traditional evaluation metrics, designed for Boolean retrieval or top-k retrieval, include precision and recall. All measures assume a ground truth notion of relevance: every document is known to be either relevant or non-relevant to a particular query. In practice, queries may be ill-posed and there may be different shades of relevance.\n\n\n== Libraries for searching and indexing ==\nLemur\nLucene\nSolr\nElasticsearch\nManatee\nManticore search\nSphinx\nTerrier Search Engine\nXapian\n\n\n== Timeline ==\nBefore the 1900s\n1801: Joseph Marie Jacquard invents the Jacquard loom, the first machine to use punched cards to control a sequence of operations.\n1880s: Herman Hollerith invents an electro-mechanical data tabulator using punch cards as a machine readable medium.\n1890 Hollerith cards, keypunches and tabulators used to process the 1890 US census data.\n1920s–1930s\nEmanuel Goldberg submits patents for his \"Statistical Machine\", a document search engine that used photoelectric cells and pattern recognition to search the metadata on rolls of microfilmed documents.\n1940s–1950s\nlate 1940s: The US military confronted problems of indexing and retrieval of wartime scientific research documents captured from Germans.\n1945: Vannevar Bush's As We May Think appeared in Atlantic Monthly.\n1947: Hans Peter Luhn (research engineer at IBM since 1941) began work on a mechanized punch card-based system for searching chemical compounds.\n1950s: Growing concern in the US for a \"science gap\" with the USSR motivated, encouraged funding and provided a backdrop for mechanized literature searching systems (Allen Kent et al.) and the invention of the citation index by Eugene Garfield.\n1950: The term \"information retrieval\" was coined by Calvin Mooers.\n1951: Philip Bagley conducted the earliest experiment in computerized document retrieval in a master thesis at MIT.\n1955: Allen Kent joined Case Western Reserve University, and eventually became associate director of the Center for Documentation and Communications Research.
