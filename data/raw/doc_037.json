  "content": "In information retrieval, tf–idf (term frequency–inverse document frequency, TF*IDF, TFIDF, TF–IDF, or Tf–idf) is a measure of importance of a word to a document in a collection or corpus, adjusted for the fact that some words appear more frequently in general. Like the bag-of-words model, it models a document as a multiset of words, without word order. It is a refinement over the simple bag-of-words model, by allowing the weight of words to depend on the rest of the corpus.\nIt was often used as a weighting factor in searches of information retrieval, text mining, and user modeling. A survey conducted in 2015 showed that 83% of text-based recommender systems in digital libraries used tf–idf. Variations of the tf–idf weighting scheme were often used by search engines as a central tool in scoring and ranking a document's relevance given a user query. In applied search engine optimization practice, tf–idf is also described as a method for analysing term importance within web pages and supporting semantic SEO techniques. One of the simplest ranking functions is computed by summing the tf–idf for each query term; many more sophisticated ranking functions are variants of this simple model.\n\n\n== Motivations ==\nKaren Spärck Jones (1972) conceived a statistical interpretation of term-specificity called Inverse Document Frequency (idf), which became a cornerstone of term weighting:\n\nThe specificity of a term can be quantified as an inverse function of the number of documents in which it occurs.For example, the df (document frequency) and idf for some words in Shakespeare's 37 plays might be represented as follows:\n\nWe see that \"Romeo\", \"Falstaff\", and \"salad\" appears in very few plays, so seeing these words, one could get a good idea as to which play it might be. In contrast, \"good\" and \"sweet\" appears in every play and are completely uninformative as to which play it is.\n\n\n== Definition ==\nThe tf–idf is the product of two statistics, term frequency and inverse document frequency. There are various ways for determining the exact values of both statistics.\nA formula that aims to define the importance of a keyword or phrase within a document or a web page.\n\n\n=== Term frequency ===\nTerm frequency, tf(t,d), is the relative frequency of term t within document d, \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          t\n          f\n        \n        (\n        t\n        ,\n        d\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              f\n              \n                t\n                ,\n                d\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                ∑\n                \n                  \n                    t\n                    ′\n                  \n                  ∈\n                  d\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  f\n                  \n                    \n                      t\n                      ′\n                    \n                    ,\n                    d\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {tf} (t,d)={\\frac {f_{t,d}}{\\sum _{t'\\in d}{f_{t',d}}}}}\n  \n,\nwhere ft,d is the raw count of a term in a document, i.e., the number of times that term t occurs in document d.

Since the ratio inside the idf's log function is always greater than or equal to 1, the value of idf (and tf–idf) is greater than or equal to 0. As a term appears in more documents, the ratio inside the logarithm approaches 1, bringing the idf and tf–idf closer to 0.\n\n\n== Justification of idf ==\nIdf was introduced as \"term specificity\" by Karen Spärck Jones in a 1972 paper. Although it has worked well as a heuristic, its theoretical foundations have been troublesome for at least three decades afterward, with many researchers trying to find information theoretic justifications for it.\nSpärck Jones's own explanation did not propose much theory, aside from a connection to Zipf's law.

In 1998, the concept of idf was applied to citations. The authors argued that \"if a very uncommon citation is shared by two documents, this should be weighted more highly than a citation made by a large number of documents\". In addition, tf–idf was applied to \"visual words\" with the purpose of conducting object matching in videos, and entire sentences. However, the concept of tf–idf did not prove to be more effective in all cases than a plain tf scheme (without idf). When tf–idf was applied to citations, researchers could find no improvement over a simple citation-count weight that had no idf component.\n\n\n== Derivatives ==\nA number of term-weighting schemes have derived from tf–idf. One of them is TF–PDF (term frequency * proportional document frequency). TF–PDF was introduced in 2001 in the context of identifying emerging topics in the media. The PDF component measures the difference of how often a term occurs in different domains. Another derivate is TF–IDuF. In TF–IDuF, idf is not calculated based on the document corpus that is to be searched or recommended. Instead, idf is calculated on users' personal document collections. The authors report that TF–IDuF was equally effective as tf–idf but could also be applied in situations when, e.g., a user modeling system has no access to a global document corpus. The DELTA TF-IDF  derivative uses the difference in importance of a term across two specific classes, like positive and negative sentiment. For example, it can assign a high score to a word like \"excellent\" in positive reviews and a low score to the same word in negative reviews. This helps identify words that strongly indicate the sentiment of a document, potentially leading to improved accuracy in text classification tasks.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\nSalton, G; McGill, M.
